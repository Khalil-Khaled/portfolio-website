      "challenge": "Financial institutions needed a way to rapidly build and deploy custom applications without extensive development resources. Traditional development cycles were too slow and expensive, with duplicated code across projects and no centralized component management. The company needed a platform that would dramatically reduce time-to-market while maintaining quality and consistency.",
      "solution": "I contributed to and progressively took ownership of the frontend development of a comprehensive low-code platform built on an NX monorepo architecture with Angular 20, RxJS, NgRx, and Signals. Over the last 3 years, I co-led development alongside a colleague, driving major technical decisions. The platform enables users to design UML diagrams that generate backend code, create Angular frontends through drag-and-drop in the visual designer, write custom implementations in an embedded VS Code editor, and build/run applications with real-time log monitoring. I architected and implemented a reusable component library of 75+ widgets exposed via Storybook, integrated complex libraries (bpmn.js for business process modeling, CodeMirror, JointJS, GridStack), and built real-time features including a notifications center with WebSocket integration and log streaming from Grafana. I also created the SASS/CSS theming system for the platform's rebranding and developed the design system theme for all generated applications.",
      "results": "The platform now serves 3 major financial institutions with 150+ active users, reducing application development time by 40%. Over 5 years, I resolved 520+ bugs and delivered 110+ features. The component library achieved 93%+ test coverage. CI/CD optimizations resulted in 65% faster build times, 30% fewer pipeline failures, and 30% reduction in build artifact size. Successfully contributed to multiple Angular upgrades, with the latest migration to Angular v20 affecting both the platform and all generated applications.",
